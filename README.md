# Gesture-Volume-Control
This project allows you to control your Windows system volume using hand gestures captured via webcam in real-time. By tracking the distance between your thumb and index finger, you can smoothly increase or decrease the volume. It also supports mute and unmute gestures using simple hand signs.
